Installation:
-------------

You'll need headers for libpurple, glib and dbus-glib. Optionally also
gettext. After that it's just a matter of:

$ cmake .
$ make

Or, for an out of source build:

$ cd [path to build-dir]
$ cmake [path to source]
$ make

Optional:

# make install

Another option is copying the resulting libawayonlock.so file to your
~/.purple/plugins directory, in which case i18n won't work, but it
doesn't need root privileges.
